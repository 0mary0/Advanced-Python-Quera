#Advanced Python — Quera Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advanced Python course exercises from the Quera platform. The goal of this repository is to document problem-solving approaches, algorithmic techniques, and Python-specific implementations developed throughout the course.

The solutions emphasize:

Efficient algorithm design and optimization

Clean, readable, and maintainable Python code

Use of advanced Python features such as generators, decorators, recursion, functional programming constructs, and standard-library utilities

Mathematical and combinatorial problem solving

Performance-aware implementations suitable for competitive programming environments

Each directory corresponds to a specific topic or assignment set, and individual files contain fully working solutions along with minimal explanatory comments where necessary.

This repository serves both as a personal learning archive and as a reference for advanced Python programming patterns applied to algorithmic challenges.
